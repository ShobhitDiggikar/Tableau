# Tableau
Some of the Tableau dashboards I made and some notes from my Tableau experience.</br>

The most basic things are dimensions and measures in Tableau. Dimensions are categorical values and measures are quantifiable values.</br>
Tooltip is the thing which pops up when you drag the cursor on any point, it's like a pop-up window. Of-course you can edit the tooltip, it gives you the ability to show the info that you want the people to see</br> 

Somethimes we convert dimensions into measures for visualization because if visualize dimension directly we get AGG. version, therefore to aviod that, we convert dimension into the measure.
